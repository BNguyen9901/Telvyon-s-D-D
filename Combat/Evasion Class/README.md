Evasion Class is a dynamic indicator of the character's ability to Dodge Attacks.
Evasion Class is split into two types:

-Active EC: a dodge roll upon reaction (D20 + armor Dex modifier x 1d4 + additional modifiers)

-Passive EC: the minimum threshold when not reacting (10 + Dex modifiers + additional modifiers)  

Attack Rolls must exceed the calculated EC to land a hit.
