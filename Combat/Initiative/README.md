The initiative is an indicator that determines the order of actions among the present characters in combat (d12 - Dex modifier), 0 meaning that a character can act. 
Unlike 5e, actions are not fixed to a single turn, meaning that a player may act multiple times in a single turn or skip turns depending on the action taken.

A turn ends when each character made at least one action.

Each action has a delay indicator that determines the amount of units a player must wait before executing said action. Some actions can be executed instantly, while others may take multiple turns. 
The initiatives of all other characters get deducted by the active character's initiative.

After declaring an action, the player will need to roll a cooldown initiative for their next turn.


Ex: 
Player 1 rolled a 5
Player 2 rolled a 7

Player 1 prepares to cast a cantation spell (Rolled: 11)

Player 1 initiative: 11
Player 2 initiative: 2

Player 2 attacks (Rolled: 10)

Player 1 initiative: 9
Player 2 initiative: 10
